### Hi there üëã
My name is Rafa≈Ç "Stukeley" Klinowski, also known as "Stukeleyak".

I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Technology, graduated from Politechnika ≈ölƒÖska, Gliwice, Poland in February 2023.

### Technologies üíª
Originally a Freelance .NET developer, I have quite recently become interested in the world of Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to enroll in a Ph.D. program and research the use of AI in fields such as image processing (spoof detection, quality of image upscaling), games (reinforcement learning, AI narrative) and performance engineering.

My AI skills include:
- Python
- R
- TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning
- Data Analysis

In the past, I was in love with C#.  I think it's a modern, clean language, that can be used to achieve almost anything. I have been using it for about 6 years now, and I am comfortable with technologies such as WinForms, WPF, MAUI, ASP.NET, and more.

I am also familiar with Relational Databases (including Entity Framework, and MsSQL) and a few other languages: C, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

I'm eager to learn and constantly expand my skills by learning new frameworks and technologies. In fact, I love learning, and knowledge is what drives me forward.

Back in the day, I was also passionate about Creative Coding. You can find some of my old samples [here](https://github.com/Stukeley/p5js-projects).

### Freelancing üë®‚Äçüíª
I work as a freelance software developer on Fiverr. Ever since I started, I learned a lot about how to properly create and document software, and more importantly - how to communicate with my clients.

I am currently open to projects of any size - ranging from simple school projects, through more complex programs, bug fixing, and performance engineering, as well as large-size applications with a User Interface. If you need anything, feel free to contact me, and we can discuss the details :)

### Website ‚úç
I run a website along with a blog, where I talk about programming in general, especially: C#, ASM, code optimization, machine learning, and others. If you're interested in some of my projects or want to learn about some less-known aspects of C#, feel free to follow for weekly updates!
