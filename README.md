### Hi there 👋
My name is Rafał "Stukeley" Klinowski, also known as "Stukeleyak". I'm a second year student of Information Technology at Politechnika Śląska, Poland.

### Technologies 💻
I'm in love with C#. I think it's a modern, clean language, that can be used to achieve almost anything. I have been using it for about 4 years now, and I am comfortable in technologies such as: WinForms, WPF, UWP, ASP.NET, Uno and more.

I am also familiar with Relational Databases (including Entity Framework), Machine Learning (ML.NET), and other languages: C, C++, JavaScript, F#.

I have created bots for Twitch, Reddit and Discord - the three places where I spend most of my free time - all using C#!

I'm eager to learn, and I'm constantly expanding my skills by learning new frameworks and technologies.

Back in the day, I was also passionate about Creative Coding. You can find some of my old samples [here](https://github.com/Stukeley/p5js-projects).

### Freelancing 👨‍💻
I have been working as a Freelance .NET Developer on Fiverr for a few months now. During this time, I have learned a lot about working with practical projects, creating business and personal applications, as well as implementing new features on existing code. It has been a fun and learning experience!

### Blog ✍
I run a blog about programming in C#! If you're interested in some of my projects, or want to learn about some less-known aspects of C#, feel free to follow for weekly updates!
