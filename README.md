### Hi there 👋
My name is Rafał "Stukeley" Klinowski, also known as "Stukeleyak".

I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Technology, graduated from Politechnika Śląska, Gliwice, Poland in 2023.

### Technologies 💻
I'm in love with C#. I think it's a modern, clean language, that can be used to achieve almost anything. I have been using it for about 6 years now, and I am comfortable in technologies such as: WinForms, WPF, MAUI, ASP.NET and more.

I am also familiar with Relational Databases (including Entity Framework, MsSQL), Machine Learning (ML.NET, TensorFlow), and other languages: C, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP.

I have created bots for Twitch, Reddit and Discord - the three places where I spend most of my free time - all using C# with use of publicly available APIs!

I'm eager to learn, and I'm constantly expanding my skills by learning new frameworks and technologies.

Back in the day, I was also passionate about Creative Coding. You can find some of my old samples [here](https://github.com/Stukeley/p5js-projects).

### Freelancing 👨‍💻
I work as a freelance software developer on Fiverr. Ever since I started, a learned a lot about how to properly create and document software, and more importantly - how to communicate with my clients.

I am currently open to projects of any size - ranging from simple school projects, through more complex programs, bug fixing, and performance engineering, as well as large-size applications with a User Interface. If you need anything, feel free to contact me, and we can discuss the details :)

### Website ✍
I run a website along with a blog, where I talk about programming in general, especially: C#, ASM, code optimization, machine learning, and others. If you're interested in some of my projects, or want to learn about some less-known aspects of C#, feel free to follow for weekly updates!
